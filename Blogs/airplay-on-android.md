Is there **AirPlay for Android**? Android devices don't natively support Apple AirPlay, whether on smartphones or smart TVs (except some Sony and Vizio models). However, that doesn't mean you can't stream between Android and Apple devices. This guide explains why AirPlay isn't built into Android and shows you simple ways to AirPlay from Android to a MacBook or Apple TV and from iPhone to an Android TV with ease.

## Can You Use AirPlay on Android Devices?

Natively, you can't use Apple AirPlay on Android phones. AirPlay is a proprietary technology for Apple devices, such as iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and Apple TVs, while its successor, AirPlay 2, is available for other devices, such as Samsung speakers or TVs. AirPlay and AirPlay 2 make it easy to stream between these devices.

Android devices use various mirroring protocols to stream content, including Google Cast, Miracast, DLNA, etc.

| **Technology**                                               | **Description**                                              | **Supported Devices**                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Cast(Chromecast)                                      | Google's native streaming protocol. Allowing casting content and mirroring the entire screen. | Most Android TVs, Google TV, and Chromecast devices |
| [Miracast](https://www.avaccess.com/blogs/guides/what-is-miracast/) | A peer-to-peer wireless screencast technology is built into many Android phones and TVs. | Older Android TVs, Windows PCs                      |
| [DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance)](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00106319) | Enables media sharing (not full screen mirroring)            | Many smart televisions, media servers               |
| [Wi-Fi Direct](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/what-is-wifi-direct) | Enables devices to connect directly over Wi-Fi without a router. Often used in conjunction with Miracast. | Some Android phones and TVs                         |

Are these protocols compatible with Apple AirPlay? No, they are not directly compatible with Apple AirPlay. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Google Cast (Chromecast):** AirPlay and Google Cast are completely separate ecosystems. You can't cast from Android using AirPlay.
- **Miracast:** AirPlay doesn't support Miracast. Apple dropped support for Miracast-like standard in favor of AirPlay.
- **DLNA:** AirPlay doesn't support DLNA. Some third-party apps can bridge the gap, but the process is not seamless.
- **Wi-Fi Direct:** AirPlay utilizes its own discovery and streaming protocols (Bonjour and HLS/RTSP), rather than Wi-Fi Direct.

All in all, there is a clear gap between Android devices and Apple devices, as their built-in protocols, such as AirPlay, Google Cast, and Miracast, are not cross-compatible and can't bridge that divide on their own.

However, third-party apps like [PigeonCast](https://pigeoncast.com) can fill this gap by simulating AirPlay or Cast functionality, allowing devices from both ecosystems to communicate. Whether you want to [stream from Android to an Apple TV](https://pigeoncast.com/blogs/cast-android-to-apple-tv), or mirror your iPhone to an Android TV, these tools make it possible with just a few taps.

## How to AirPlay from iPhone to Android TVs?

Some Android TVs now come with built-in AirPlay 2, allowing you to stream video, photos, or music directly from your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Sony, for example, began integrating AirPlay in select models starting in 2019–2020. Compatible models include:

- A-Series OLEDs: A8H, A9G, A9S, A9F
- Z-Series LCDs: Z8H, Z9G, Z9F
- X-Series: X80H/X81H, X85H/G, X90H/X91H, X95H/G

If you own one of these models, mirroring your iPhone to your Android TV is simple:

1. Make sure both your iPhone and TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
